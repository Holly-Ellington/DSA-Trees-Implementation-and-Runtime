# DSA-Trees-Implementation-and-Runtime

Trees: Implementation and runtime
To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

Implement a binary search tree
Instructions
Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing BinarySearchTree class to implement a binary search tree with lookup, insert, and delete capabilities.

Existing files
File path	Description
src/main.js	Contains some example uses of the BinarySearchTree class.
src/BinarySearchTree.js	Contains the definition of the BinarySearchTree class. The constructor() method has already been completed for you.
Tasks
Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

In the src/BinarySeachTree.js file:

Complete the insert() method to insert a node into the BST. The method should accept a key and a value as its arguments.

Complete the find() method, which should accept a key as its argument and return the value for the given key in the BST. Throw an Error() with a string error message if the node is not found in the BST.

Complete the remove() method to delete a node with a given key in the BST. Throw an Error() with a string error message if the node to be removed is not found in the BST.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
